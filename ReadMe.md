80386 PC emulator written in Qt/C++

## About

I've been hacking this on and off since 2003, when I was a young man trying to learn C.

It was a pretty decent 80186 PC emulator for a long time, and I'm now working on 80386+ support.

The aim here is not to go fast, but to learn about PC internals by implementing them.
